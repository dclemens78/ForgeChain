# ForgeChain

# THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

This project seeks to improve on my previous blockchain in several ways. Completion date is unknown, but I will work on it as I see fit. Will it be monitized? Unlikely, however if this project faces minimal issues, I will certaintly consider it (only if it provides real world utility).

# About the Creator

My name is Danny Clemens, and I am a Computer Science graduate and aspiring AI/ML engineer. I have an overall fascination with ML algorithms and concepts, along with ethics in AI. One of my side passions is crypto, and while I would not consider myself an expert, I am fascinated by the code behind it and wish to replicate for myself, and maybe work on blockchains in the future. I also have industry experience in DevOps and QA, but my love for Computer Science extends far beyond any discipline.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please reach out to me!
